## Requirements:

ðŸŽ¯ Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk.  
ðŸŽ¯ Create and display an error page if the user visits a user profile that doesnâ€™t exist.  
ðŸŽ¯ Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive or something similar (e.g. use of another library to enhance UX).  
ðŸŽ¯ Enable users to create a user profile, and input profile information (such as a user biography) using a form. Users and user information should be stored in their own table in the database and handled with an appropriate route (e.g. /user/[userId]).  
ðŸŽ¯ Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the userâ€™s profile page.

## To do:

-- Use UI liabrary
